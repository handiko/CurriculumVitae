**RF Telemetry, Microcontroller, & Electronics Enthusiast**

*Please visit the web version of this page at:* https://handiko.github.io/

I am a fast learner who eager to learn new things, do the most optimal way, and present in the best way. During my study, I did a lot of development on radio telemetry projects (hardware and software), microcontroller programming, antenna design, and signal processing. I am also active in teamwork projects such as Techno Antenna Fair Competition committee, Sensor and Telecontrolling System Lab assistant, CORE ORARI Daerah DIY team, and YE2A Contest Team. 
Currently, I am looking for a great team who do a lot of development or research in telemetry/electronics engineering, and eager to bring the best results of the works.

## Skills
### **Atmel AVR Microcontrollers & Arduino**
I learn this skill mainly by autodidact during my activity in the Telemetry study group. I started this skill on the Atmel AVR microcontrollers using CV-AVR and already migrated to the Arduino environment by now. Few of my projects which using Atmel AVR microcontrollers:
* APRS Tracker using Arduino UNO & DRA818V VHF Radio Module: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/Arduino-APRS/)
* Arduino RFpainter - Abusing FMCW to Paint Cats on Spectrogram: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/Arduino-RFpainter/)
* Re-flashing JDY-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module with HM-10 firmware: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/JDY-08-Reflash/)
* iBeacon using a JDY-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/iBeacon/)

### **RF Telemetry & Hardware Electronics**
I learn this skill while I am included in Telemetry study group. I am comfortably working on VHF and UHF radio spectrum and also using HF spectrum as a part of my hobby. Few of my projects:
* VHF Telemetry Shield for Arduino UNO: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/Dorji-TX-Shield/)
* VHF Low Noise Amplifier with a Band Pass Filter: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/VHF-LNA/)
* 4 elements VHF antenna: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/Yagi-4E-144/)
* ESP-12E/F Eagle PCB Library: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/ESP-12EF-Eagle-Library/)
* I contribute to the YE2A Contest Team (Grobogan, Central Java) as a technical team and operator.

### **Software Defined Radio (SDR) & GNU Radio**
I learn this skill mainly for rapid prototyping and to built an SDR application on receiving telemetry for Sensor and Telecontrolling System Lab. Few of my projects:
* Receiving and demodulating weather image transmission from a Russian satellite using a low cost SDR dongle: [published here](https://www.hackster.io/handiko/receiving-russian-s-satellite-weather-image-from-space-d4618d) or [here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/2018/09/17/receiving-qpsk-signal-from-space/)
* Receiving Radio Transmission from Seoul - South Korea using a Low Cost SDR dongle and GNU Radio: [published here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/2018/08/20/receiving-post-processing-hlg-seoul-radio-using-rtl-sdr-and-gnu-radio/)
* gr-Merapi, an SDR application on GNU Radio platform for receiving and decoding Mt. Merapi telemetry: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/gr-Merapi/)
* gr-APRS, an SDR application on GNU Radio for receiving and decoding APRS packets: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/gr-APRS/)
* How to Stream the Audio Out from GNU Radio into VLC Media Player: [GitHub page](https://handiko.github.io/RTL-FM-VLC/)

### **Antenna Design and Simulation**
I learn this skill mainly for supporting the projects above and as a part of my hobby. Several of them are written as articles:
* How to match an antenna: [published here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/2017/11/17/matching-an-antenna/)
* Inverted-V versus Vertical Antenna: [published here](https://www.ybdxc.net/2017/11/06/inverted-vee-versus-vertical-antenna-for-dx-contact/) or [here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/2017/11/06/inverted-vee-versus-vertical-antenna-for-dx-contact/)
* How to get a 50 Ohm match on your vertical antenna: [published here](https://www.ybdxc.net/2017/11/09/overload-your-vertical-antenna/) or [here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/2017/11/09/overload-your-vertical-antenna-2nd-part-of-the-series/)
* 2 x 2 elements vertical array: [published here](https://labsdl.wordpress.com/2017/11/19/40-m-band-vertical-on-steroids/)
