# Handiko Gesang Anugrah Sejati, S.T.
**RF Telemetry, Microcontroller, & Electronics Enthusiast**

I am a fast learner who eager to learn new things, do the most optimal way, and present in the best way. During my study, I did a lot of development on radio telemetry projects (hardware and software), microcontroller programming, antenna design, and signal processing. I am also active in teamwork projects such as Techno Antenna Fair Competition committee, Sensor and Telecontrolling System Lab assistant, CORE ORARI Daerah DIY team, and YE2A Contest Team. 
Currently, I am looking for a great team who doing a lot of research or development in telemetry/electronics engineering, and eager to bring the best results of the works.

## Skills
**Atmel AVR Microcontrollers & Arduino**

I learn this skill mainly by autodidact and through the instrumentation study group. I started this skill on the Atmel AVR microcontrollers using CV-AVR and already migrated to the Arduino platform by now. Few of my projects which using Atmel AVR microcontrollers:
* APRS Tracker using Arduino UNO & DRA818V VHF Radio Module : https://github.com/handiko/Arduino-APRS
* Re-flashing JDY-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module with HM-10 firmware : https://github.com/handiko/JDY-08-Reflash
* iBeacon using a JDY-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module :

**RF Telemetry & Hardware Electronics**
I learn this skill while I am included in Telemetry study group. I am comfortably working on VHF and UHF radio spectrum and also using HF spectrum as a part of my hobby. Few of my projects:
* VHF Telemetry Shield for Arduino UNO : https://github.com/handiko/Dorji-TX-Shield
* VHF Low Noise Amplifier with a Band Pass Filter : https://github.com/handiko/VHF-LNA
* 4 elements VHF antenna :
* I contribute to the YE2A Contest Team (Grobogan, Central Java) as a technical team and operator.

**Software Defined Radio (SDR) & GNU Radio**
I learn this skill mainly for rapid prototyping and to built an SDR application on receiving telemetry for Sensor and Telecontrolling System Lab. Few of my projects:
* gr-Meteor-M2, an SDR application on GNU Radio for receiving and demodulating Russian Satellite weather image transmission using a low cost SDR dongle: https://www.hackster.io/handiko/receiving-russian-s-satellite-weather-image-from-space-d4618d
* gr-Merapi, an SDR application on GNU Radio platform for receiving and decoding Mt. Merapi telemetry: https://github.com/handiko/gr-Merapi
* gr-APRS, an SDR application on GNU Radio for receiving and decoding APRS packets:  https://github.com/handiko/gr-Merapi
