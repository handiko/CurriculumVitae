**RF Telemetry, Microcontroller, & Electronics Enthusiast**

I am a fast learner who eager to learn new things, do the most optimal way, and present in the best way. During my study, I did a lot of development on radio telemetry projects (hardware and software), microcontroller programming, antenna design, and signal processing. I am also active in teamwork projects such as Techno Antenna Fair Competition committee, Sensor and Telecontrolling System Lab assistant, CORE ORARI Daerah DIY team, and YE2A Contest Team. 
Currently, I am looking for a great team who doing a lot of research or development in telemetry/electronics engineering, and eager to bring the best results of the works.

## Skills
**Atmel AVR Microcontrollers**

I learn this skill mainly by autodidact and through the instrumentation study group. I started this skill on the Atmel AVR microcontrollers using CV-AVR and already migrated to the Arduino platform by now. Few of my projects which using Atmel AVR microcontrollers:
* APRS Tracker using Arduino UNO & DRA818V VHF Radio Module : https://github.com/handiko/Arduino-APRS
* Re-flashing JDY-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module with HM-10 firmware : https://github.com/handiko/JDY-08-Reflash
* iBeacon using a JDY-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module :
